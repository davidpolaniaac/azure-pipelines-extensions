# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Extension

This extension includes a release gate to calculate average sentiment of tweets made for a hashtag. The gate is useful to ensure that there is positivity in tweets made for the application updated on an environment before promoting the release to the next environment. 

It uses [Text Analytics API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics) from Azure Cognitive Services for sentiment analysis of the tweets.

## Prerequisites

### Create Azure Function

The gate uses an [Azure function](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions) for a server less on-demand processing of tweets received for a hashtag. [Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function) an HTTP triggered function and use this [sample code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-rm-extensions/blob/master/Extensions/TwitterSentimentAnalysis/Src/TwitterSentimentAnalysisAzureFunction.txt) in the Azure function.

### Obtain Consumer key and secret for Twitter

If you don't have twitter application, create [Twitter application](https://apps.twitter.com/) for using Twitter REST APIs. Once you create a twitter application, get the 'Consumer Key' and 'Consumer Secret' from 'Keys and Access Tokens' tab. 

### Obtain Azure Cognitive Services access key

[Text Analytics API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics) from Azure Cognitive Services is used in the [sample azure function](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-rm-extensions/blob/master/Extensions/TwitterSentimentAnalysis/Src/TwitterSentimentAnalysisAzureFunction.txt) for sentiment analysis of the tweets. Cognitive service access key is required to use Text Analytics APIs. Follow this [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-access-key) to obtain a cognitive service access key.

 - **Azure function url**:  Url of the Azure function that needs to be invokedâ€‹. Example:- https://azurefunctionapp.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTriggerCS1.
 
 - **Azure function key**:  Function or Host key with which we can access this function. To keep the key secure, define a secret variable and use it here. Example: - $(myFunctionKey) where myFunctionKey is an environment level secret variable with value as the secret key like ZxPXnIEODXLRzYwCw1TgZ4osMfoKs9Zn6se6X/N0FnztfDvZbdOmYw==.
 
 - **Cognitive services access key**:  Specify access key for Text Analytics API. To keep the key secure, define a secret variable and use it here. Follow this [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-access-key) to obtain a cognitive service access key.

 - **Cognitive services endpoint region**:  Specify the region corresponding to the Text Analytics API endpoint.

 - **Analyze tweets since**:  Analyze the tweets made after this time. By default, uses $(Release.Deployment.StartTime) and analyzes the tweets made after start of the deployment. Date and time should be in UTC and format should be yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ. eg. 2018-01-31T07:56:59Z
